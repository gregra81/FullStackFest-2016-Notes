#Â The Physical Web: building on top of the open web by Scott Jenson

The Physical Web is a very simple idea: find URLs around you easily. However, this unassuming idea unlocks a whole new open ecosystem. As the web gets better, it makes the Physical Web look brilliant, but honestly, it's the web that's being awesome, the Physical Web is just getting a free ride. This talk will discuss some of the amazing concepts and future directions from the web community that are making the Physical Web look so promising.

The Physical Web essentially allows you to put a small beacon in some physical object and transmit an URL using BLE. 
This is a very powerful concept, as it allows to interact with objects around you without the need of downloading a mobile app. 
For example you can approach a parking meter, see its URL, open it and pay for your parking without installing an app. Or approach a monument, open its URL and read more about it. 
Or have a box of pills, which broadcasts an URL, on which you can monitor when you need to take your medication and once you access it, receive push notifications when you need to take the next dose. The possibilities are endless, so I urge you to read more about Physical Web and tell people around you more about it. This simple technology looks like a peek in the future.
